How to play
===========

If you have CodeBlocks installed, you should be able to download the repo, open
the project and run it.

If not, download the repo and try running the build in Builds/Debug/. If that doesn't
work you may need to install the Visual C++ Redistributable package. (I'm not 100% sure)
